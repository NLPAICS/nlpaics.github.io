o	Detection and mitigation of hate speech and offensive language 
o	Fake news, deepfakes, misinformation and disinformation
o	Detection of machine generated language in multimodal context (text, speech
and gesture)
•	User Security and Safety
o	Cyberbullying and identification of internet offenders
o	Monitoring extremist fora
o	Suicide prevention 
•	Technical Measures and Solutions
o	Social engineering identification, phishing detection
o	NLP for risk assessment
o	Controlled languages for safe messages
o	Prevention of malicious use of ai models
o	Forensic linguistics
•	Human Factors in Cyber Security

Speech Technology and Multimodal Investigations for Cyber Security
•	Voice-based security: Analysis of voice recordings or transcripts for security threats
